-  Test Driven Development (TDD)
- The Red, Green, Refactor Loop
  1. Red: Write a failing test for the desired functionality.
  2. Green: Implement the simplest thing that can work to make the test pass.
  3. Refactor: Look for opportunities to simplify, reduce duplication, or otherwise improve the code without changing any behaviorâ€”to refactor.
  4. Repeat!
